# Data Structures Fundamentals Tutorial
Welcome to the Data Structure Fundamentals Tutorial. Every beginning data structure programmer should understand these basic topics:

* [Stacks ](stacks/stack.md)
* [Linked Lists](linked_lists/linked_lists.md)
* [Binary Search Trees](binary_tree/binary_tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
