# Linked Lists
Linked lists are a very handy kind of test.  They're 
like arrays, but instead of having one value for each 
value, you remember the data after as well. The best 
example of this is file management on computers. We love 
organization which is exactly why we use linked lists. 
It makes tasks much easier when we can recall values 
this way. In terminal based systems we use the change 
directory command "cd" to switch the directories we're 
in. Directories can also be viewed as a folder. It's 
where we choose to store certain items. The way this 
relates to a linked list is that when you view a folder 
it will recall what's in it and where it is. 
Specifically the path to get there.

This is the most common example of linked lists in 
modern society. To access files, we need to recall which 
areas are coming along next. That is the exact purpose 
and function of linked lists. How would one carry this 
method out? Well we first would need to introduce Nodes. 
Imagine a christmas advent calendar. Each box has the 
day and item inside connected to its value. A Node in 
this situation would be each individual box. Each one is 
the location where we keep all the information we need 
for that specific Node in that data structure. In a 
linked list the Node will include a piece of data and 
the address of the following data.
